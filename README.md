```

```
pod install
```


## Manually

1. Download the latest code version .
2. Open your project in Xcode,drag the `JQProgressHUD ` folder into your project.  Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project.


## Usage

JQProgressHUDTool.jq_showToastHUD( msg: "this is toast")
```

```
JQProgressHUDTool.jq_showNormalHUD(msg: "loading...")
